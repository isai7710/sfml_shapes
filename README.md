# Visualizing Custom Shapes using VertexArray in SFML

Project based on Pezza's Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/3CWsy4kP6wU?si=JVRANH8qrj0mO8yg) on creating beautiful UI. Hopefully he comes out with some more videos to this series soon, they are fantastic. Built using CMake tools, C++ and of course, SFML.
